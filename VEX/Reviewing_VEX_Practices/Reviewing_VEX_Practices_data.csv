This vulnerability database produces a feed that then is consumed by different integrations with vulnerability scanners like Trivy <respondent link> so that these scanners can report vulnerabilities in our comments to their users. 
Our vulnerability database follows the Open Source Vulnerability Schema format (https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema) and those vulnerabilities are also published to the OSV database (https://osv.dev/).",Yes,OSV,Yes,Yes,"From our vulnerability database we periodically track any new vulnerabilities that might be affecting our software packages. Then a dedicated team assesses individually each new vulnerability and its impact. Those vulnerabilities are typically associated with binaries’ individual packages. 
Our team then enters details about how those packages are affected into an internal system that contains an inventory of our deliverables, typically container images, Helm charts and Virtual Machines, the packages that make those deliverables and the vulnerabilities associated with those packages.
Adding the assessment data creates the full picture of the real vulnerability footprint of our products. This in-house system can be queried at any time to produce a CSAF document for a given container image, Helm chart or Virtual Machine. Those CSAF documents are distributed to our customers as part of the commercial product, 'Product' following an automated standard process. A Respondent customer subscribes to software applications (Mongodb, PostgreSQL, etc. ) and from that moment Product tracks upstream releases and make sure customers get the latest releases and patches for all the supported branches. For each of these automated delivery processes, Product runs all sorts of compliance tasks. This includes things like vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation, package signing and also VEX assessment generation.",CSAF,Internal,Our VEX assessments usually contain VEX information for any vulnerability that can be associated with our Respondent packages.

Our hope is to expand the support for other operating systems in the long term.

We are also exploring the area of a graphical representation of VEX assessments.
",Yes,"Our enterprise offering revolves around the idea of providing safer Open Source software to companies that want OSS built on top of usual Linux distributions. Those distributions are usually full of vulnerabilities that don’t affect the final software. Also, upstream OSS projects are commonly target of CVEs that turn out to be false positives, or also that might not be valid on the configurations that we ship to our customers. 

With customers much more sensitive to CVEs than ever, to us VEX is a great mechanism to reduce the noise from vulnerability scanners while still providing trust to our customers. ","I think making a simple standard and spreading the word about the importance of having vulnerability disclosure, triaging and assessment data that can be processed by machines has been very good. We are seeing more and more directories of public VEX data that can be assimilated. These used to be websites that someone needed to crawl or to query by hand. This is an effort that is helping to add transparency in this area.

","Divergent implementations of VEX like CycloneDX’s, OpenVEX, or the CSAF VEX, have fragmented the little tooling space that exists today. This slows down adoption as vulnerability scanners and tooling need to be adapted to the different flavors.

Also these divergent implementations usually collide on the over-simplicity or the over-complexity of the product hierarchies associated with a given vulnerability which makes them not interoperable.

","Being fragmentation the biggest pain for us, having defined and sustaining a reference implementation would have helped. ",Yes,"Respondent sub-unit is a unit within Respondent that rebuilds many popular Open Source Software (OSS) projects, like for example Postgresql, Redis, Kafka, MariaDB, and many others, and packages these into different package types including container images, Kubernetes Helm charts, virtual machines or Carvel packages. Consistency in deployments and following good security practices have made Respondent one of the most popular packagers in DockerHub as well as in the Hyperscaler marketplaces. All the recipes for building software are Open Source as well and applications are packaged on top of Debian.

The Product is an enterprise offering from Respondent that builds on top of the Respodent sub-unit to offer the same OSS quality content but built on top of many other Linux distributions like RedHat UBI, Ubuntu, or Respondent Product amongst others. Content distributed through the Respondent Product is also distributed with digitally signed evidences like source code, build recipes, complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), vulnerability scans and very recently also with a list of VEX assessments for all those known affected and known not affected CVEs that were detected on the OSS products.
Respondent produces VEX for their customers in CSAF format for products built on top of Respondent OS. They are not publicly available. Upstream VEX information could be input, but is not yet produced by upstream software vendors in a machine-readable format.
",<respondent link>,"Our customers have received very well the inclusion of digitally signed vulnerability assessment information but so far none have asked for evidence on the status and justification of specific CVEs. Being a packager, we have found that usually the pressure on addressing CVEs is directed to the upstream software providers. ","For any of our packages, we always ship several other signed metadata along with the VEX assessment serving as evidence. 

Vulnerability reports from vulnerability scanners are included as proof of the vulnerability status of a given product at the time of releasing it to our customers.

1. SBOM import or Identifier change is mapped to Vulnerabilities. Each Vulnerability can have Vulnerability status through a dashboard, CLI and an API.
2. By default, all vulnerabilities start with an ""Unspecified"" status (not a VEX value).
3. Specific roles (typically App Sec/PSIRT) have permissions to update a Vulnerability's status.
4. The UI / API enforces Minimum VEX Requirements (e.g., Status 'Not Affected' requires either Justification and/or Impact Statement fields).
5. The customer has access to downloading VEX via a privately shared link (ShareLynk) at all times (or can be downloaded and sent over email by the supplier)

Recommendations
1. The first researcher investigating exploitability will mark 'Under Investigation' and the status is immediately available to all customers. In this context, first status update for a new vulnerabilitiesis quicker than actual Advisory (albeit not actionable).
2. The status is reported ONLY on vulnerability discovered against the SBOM  and not for ALL vulnerability. Interlynk surfaces its own scan result but supports adding and updating status for Vulnerabilities reported by a customer's scanner. In the Java / C example above, barring an extremely faulty scanner, only 20 such products will need to be updated.
3. The status is specified per Product/Version. Therefore if by the end of day-1, researcher has only covered 3 applications and found them to be False Positive, at least 3 product statuses are up to date and visible to customers (out of 40). This makes it quicker than full service advisory for all products.
4. We do track status propagation through the transitive dependency and allow automatic propagation of 'Not Affected' and 'False Positive' statuses.",Yes,Interlynk believes VEX alongside SBOM gives a less ambiguous representation of softtware composition and risks and therefore reduces concerns with enterprise customers that require ongoing vulnerability report in a continuous deployed environment.,"When VEX is tied with developer workflow of resolving ticket, it eliminates a layer of communication errors and keeps customer up-to-date.","Building VEX through Interlynk platform is trivial.

The vulnerabilities selected were associated with common third-party components, such as the Windows Operating system.  
For the initial VEX investigation, the POC focused on vulnerabilities that did not impact the medical device. This was done because the “Not Affected” status seems to be the most common.
The POC created the following criteria to determine what vulnerabilities require VEX statements:
* Vulnerabilities that Affect the medical device
* Vulnerabilities that are considered interesting for the consumer but the medical device is Not Affected
* Significant public attention (“Well publicized” or “Celebrity” vulnerabilities)
* Active exploitation (CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)
* Upstream vulnerability discovered (someone asks about the status)
* Status changes
* Previous VEX statement issued and the Status has changed 
* E.g. change from Under Investigation to Not Affected
* Legal/regulatory/contractual requirement 
* Publisher internal guidance
* E.g. Vulnerabilities with a reported CVSS 3.0 score of Critical or High

It's incomplete without sharing details on the exploitability of vulnerabilities, which was a critical aspect overlooked when the SBOM request was released.
Also, with all the public discussions and attention around VEX that is going on along with SBOM, our customers are going to be asking for it. We have existing tools that enable our customers today but as VEX is gaining more popularity, we will pivot and enhance our tools and processes.
With that said, VEX gives an opportunity for our customers to integrate required data in an automated way within their systems. It means the data we publish vs what is the status of a vulnerabilities must be in exact sync. All this requires resources, budget, and priority amongst other programs. ","Our existing web publication of advisories, high profile vulnerabilities like log4j or information on false positives is working for our customers. We provide prompt email notifications for any new information. ","Challenges are around aligning the CSAF framework and existing internal processes:
* The complexity of our disclosures e.g. drivers, embedded OS, firmware suppliers etc and getting alignment and consistency.
* CSAF generator requires a specific and consistent format so we can scale and automate our advisories. 
* We disclose an advisory with many CVEs not individual CVEs.

",,,,We do not have this information and will know more when the internal pilot program rolls out and we get customer feedback.,"The Dell PSIRT team manages all vulnerabilities in partnership with the engineering teams through the Vulnerability Response Champions. We will align the evidence to the PSIRT process, which supports specific statuses and justifications: For example: 
* DSA’s: Remediate vulnerabilities - require remediation plan and validation.
* Not Affected - will require a business justification and we will leverage the proposed CSAF VEX statuses.
As we roll out our new statuses, the Dell Vulnerability Response Policy will be updated.

","We see concerns that the current guidance does not follow the PSIRT framework.
Example 1: When a CVE is available, and we are working on a fix - there is no clear status to indicate that we are affected with a fix planned.
This is also raised with the OASIC TCS at Issue 662
Example 2: We often try to call things a security update and not a fix - this was due to Spectre/Meltdown where there was no complete fix. There are also times we have a mitigation or workaround and not a full fix. The terminology using the word fix is a very strong word that is not complete for all scenarios.
