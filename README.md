# SBOM Community Document Repository

This repository hosts copies of various documents drafted collaboratively by the [CISA SBOM Community](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) and through the [NTIA Multistakeholder Process on Software Component Transparency](https://www.ntia.gov/other-publication/2021/ntia-software-component-transparency). Some very closely related documents (such as translations) are also included.
